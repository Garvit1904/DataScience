# üå∏ Iris Flower Classification

A machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into one of the three species: *Iris-setosa*, *Iris-versicolor*, or *Iris-virginica* based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## üéØ Task Objectives

- Load and preprocess the Iris dataset.
- Train a classification model to identify the species of iris flowers.
- Identify the most significant features influencing classification.
- Evaluate the model using performance metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Visualize feature importance.

## üìù Project Description

This project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to classify iris flower species based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It evaluates which features are most important and assesses the model‚Äôs accuracy. The classifier achieves **100% accuracy** on the test set, showing excellent performance.
